# ChatGPT WordPress Plugin

This repository contains a sample WordPress plugin named **OpenAI Assistant**. The plugin provides a shortcode to display a small chat box that communicates with the OpenAI API through a REST endpoint. The API key can be configured from the WordPress admin area.

See the plugin's own README in `openai-assistant/README.md` for installation steps.
